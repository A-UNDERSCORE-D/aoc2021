Advent of code 2021 solutions, in Rust, Go, and Python

I tend to write the python problems first, then rust, then go. That order because go is the language
I'm most familiar with currently and I'm looking to fix that. 

I am a beginner rust user so some things will be... funny. 

You can find all the code in `aoc/`, with language specific directories. rust and python are named the numbers as words, python in the main dir, rust in a lib dir. 
go has packages for each solution.

Note that with *ALL* of them, you will need to use the appropriate `main` option, in go, thats a main.go that will run any number you ask, 
in rust thats main.rs and the same, and in python thats the *module* called `python`, ie, `cd aoc; python3 -m python`
